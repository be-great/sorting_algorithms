|3-quick_sort, 3-O| comparison-based Sorting algorithm for sorting large datasets or linked lists not for short but it's not stable like mergesort|
|100-shell_sort, 4-O| comparison-based Sorting algorithm for sorting not big dataset or small dataset and it's not stable |

|102-counting_sort| non-comparison-based sorting algorithm suitable for sorting large datasets with a small range of integer keys and stable|
|103-merge_sort, 103-O| comparison-based Sorting algorithm for sorting large lists, linked lists, large datasets not for small ones and it's stable|
