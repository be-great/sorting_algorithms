# sorting_algorithms

- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Factors to Consider when choosing sorting algorithm:-

- **üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ease of Implementation**: -

How easy it is to implement the algorithm.

- **ü§πüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Adaptability**:-

  -> Data size (small, medium, large)

  -> Data distribution (random order, already sorted, partially sorted)

  -> Data type (integer, string, etc.)

- **‚åö Time and üóÉÔ∏è Space Complexity**: -

Comparison sorts cannot perform better than O(n log n) on average, while non-comparison sorts are not limited to Œ©(n log n).

- **üßëüèª‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßëüèæ Stability**:-

 Whether the algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements. (It's for user expectation if we have a student have the same grade I want the order to be the same and not swap the student (first come first show))

- **‚ò∞ Degree of Parallelization**:-

 For efficient utilization of multiple processors or cores.
